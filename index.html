        <h1>Concept2 .csv log file movie maker</h1>
        <p>
        This application makes a movie from the data recorded by ErgData from the
        PM monitor of your Concept2 rower or SkiErg suitable for overlaying on a video.

        <h2>Use cases</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Coach wants to provide technique video <strong>and</strong>
                pace / stroke / distance / time information.</li>
            <li>Athlete wants to compare old and recent technique sessions
                <strong>simultaneously</strong> with pace / stroke / distance
                / time information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Requires</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chrome web browser (or other Canvas- and WebKit-enabled browser).</li>
            <li>A logfile from your <a href="https://log.concept2.com">Concept2 Online logbook</a>
                account. Must be uploaded via
                <a href="https://www.concept2.com/service/software/ergdata">ErgData</a>.</li>
            <li>Optional: A tool to convert <strong>.webm</strong> files to <strong>.mp4</strong> or other
                video format. Have a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=webm+to+mp4">Google</a>,
                or install and learn <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>.</li>
            <li>Optional: video editing tool of your choice.</li>

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.concept2.com/service/software/ergdata/how-to-use">
                    Upload a rowing / skiing session using ErgData</a>.</li>
            <li>Download that session from the <a href="https://log.concept2.com">logbook</a>
                as a <strong>CSV</strong> file (button at the bottom of the page).</li>
            <li>Drag and drop that .csv file on the grey rectangle above.</li>
            <li>Be patient. Wait until the status says <strong>Movie generation
                complete.</strong></li>
            <li>Two <i>faux</i>-monitors will appear. Click the three dots from
                the one on the right and choose <strong>Download</strong>.</li>
            <li>Import that file into your video editing software, or if the format
                isn't supported, use your chosen file conversion software to turn
                the <strong>.webm</strong> file into a <strong>.mp4</strong> or
                similar for your movie software.</li>
            <li>Import the resulting video into your video editing software
                and go for gold.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>How can I see other variables, like average pace?</dt>
            <dd>The Concept2 format for .csv is limited to elapsed time,
                distance, instantaneous pace, watts and cals/hr.</dd>

            <dt>But you can calculate average pace (and others) from those variables!</dt>
            <dd>Yup, this is on the list of things to fix.</dd>

            <dt>The output video format sucks. Can you change it?</dt>
            <dd>Yup, this is on the list of things to fix. If you have suggestions
                please pass them along.</dd>

            <dt>Does this handle intervals?</dt>
            <dd>Yup.</dd>

            <dt>It generates multiple movies for interval workouts!</dt>
            <dd>Yup. The Concept2 .csv format doesn't include rest periods, so
                the output movie is split into parts for easier overlaying.</dd>

            <dt>Why are there pauses in the movie at the start of each interval?</dt>
            <dd>Purely for allowing you to better sync the overlay in your editing
                software.</dd>

            <dt>Why does this miss the first few and last few seconds of an interval?</dt>
            <dd>The data provided on the Concept2 Online logbook for a session appears to
                only include data <strong>on the stroke</strong>. This means the
                <i>first stroke and the end of the workout</i> are typically missed.</dd>

            <dt>The time and distance don't increase smoothly! WTF?!?</dt>
            <dd>Yup; as stated above the Online logbook data appears to only include
                data <strong>on the stroke</strong>, not between strokes.</dd>

            <dt>So any pointers on how to sync this properly over video of me rowing?</dt>
            <dd>Yup:
                <ul>
                    <li>The frame where the numbers change from zero should be synced
                        to match the <i>end of your first (possibly <strong>second</strong>l
                        actual stroke</i>.</li>
                    <li>The last frame of of numbers should be synced to
                        match the <i>end of your last actual stroke</i>.</li>
                </ul>
                Try syncing at the end of the overlay movie first, then lock in the
                start stroke. Note that you may need to stretch either your video or
                the overlay video to get <i>100% accurate overlay goodness</i>. But
                as a savvy video editing connoisseur, you already know that.

            <dt>This doesn't work on my phone!</dt>
            <dd>Not indended for phone use; try a computer instead.</dd>

            <dt>This doesn't work on my computer!</dt>
            <dd>This application has been tested and works using the latest version
            of the <a href="https://chrome.google.com">Chrome web browser</a> on
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/macos/mojave/">Mac OS X</a>. YMMV on
            other platforms.</dd>

            <dt>The filenames of the movies are gibberish!</dt>
            <dd>Yup, this is on the list of things to fix.</dd>

            <dt>This page looks like balls!</dt>
            <dd>Yup, this is on the list of things to fix.</dd>
